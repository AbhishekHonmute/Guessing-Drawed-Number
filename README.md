# Mnist_CNN_model_with_GUI_for_drawing_image
It has GUI made using tkinter to draw image and then that image is feed to a CNN Neural Network model made using python tensorflow and the ans is showed in GUI

to run requirements :
1. Install python3
2. Install Tensorflow
3. Install tkinter

Steps : 
1. First activate virtual environment for tensorflow
2. Go to directory of project/
3. Go to directory Mnist_GUI/
4. run the file gui_tf.py using python3 command
5. Draw a image of digit on the given canvas field
6. click on scan button and you will get the output of the Neural Network on right side
